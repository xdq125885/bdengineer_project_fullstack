<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Responding in Chinese**

I see that we need to respond in Simplified Chinese since the user said "你好" (hello). It’s a brief interaction, so I'll greet them back and ask how I can help with their coding task. No need for a to-do list or tools here; keeping it simple and concise is key. I’ll also mention I can help with editing files or running searches if needed, but I want to keep it all friendly!</details></think>
